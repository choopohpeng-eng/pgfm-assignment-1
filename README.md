Project Name: NEA 2-Hour Forecast

The public can access "live" weather information for any area of interest via the NEA weather portal at https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/weather
. However, obtaining weather information for a specific region can be challenging. The portal presents weather icons across 47 regions on a map of Singapore without street names.

For users unfamiliar with maps or unaware of the location of all regions, they must hover over each icon to see a pop-up displaying the region’s name. 
This makes the portal less user-friendly, particularly for the elderly or individuals who do not read maps, and the visual presentation is quite plain.

This app addresses these challenges by presenting weather information in a clear and user-friendly interface. 
Users can view the weather for their region of interest with a single tap of a button. 
This feature benefits the elderly, less tech-savvy individuals, and busy users who want a quick overview of the weather before leaving home.

I have already installed the app on my smartphone, and it is extremely convenient. I simply select the region I am heading to, and I can quickly check the weather. 
If it is raining, I know to bring an umbrella before leaving the house.

The app retrieves live weather information from the NEA weather API and updates it at two-hour intervals.

Future upgrades could include a detailed Singapore map with street names, allowing users to locate places outside the 47 predefined regions. 
They could then check the weather for the closest region, ensuring more accurate and practical information.
